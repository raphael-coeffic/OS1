All the project was written in C.

# Ex1
We write 3 programs and you for each one, you can run him with and without flag **-g** for debugging,
For run without -g: `./byZero` `./fakeAdr` `./stackOverflow`
For run with flag -g: `./byZero_g` `./fakeAdr_g` `./stackOverflow_g`
For each one of them we save core and pictures of output of debugging gdb and ddd

# Ex2
For run please enter: `./Poisson <lambda> <k>`
We take an example picture of output.

# Ex3
For run please enter: `./PoissonLib`
We take an example picture of output.

# Ex4
For run please enter: `./dijkstra` and applies the rules of the output.
We put in the folder the example picture of output and the gcov file that show that we run on all the code with the conditions

# Ex5
For run the algo with complexity O(n) please enter: `./algoN <seed> <size>`
For run the algo with complexity O(n^2) please enter: `./algoN2 <seed> <size>`
For run the algo with complexity O(n^3) please enter: `./algoN3 <seed> <size>`
We run each one of them with sizes 100, 1000 and 10000 and for each scenario we save the profiling files.

# Ex6
For add a new line in the phone book please enter `./add2PB "<name>,<phone number>"`
